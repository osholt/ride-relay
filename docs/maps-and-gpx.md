# Maps, GPX and offline regions

GPX route geometry, waypoints, current position, hazards, and riders are stored
and rendered locally. The production map path uses the open-source MapLibre
Native SDK on both iOS and Android. It does not depend on Apple Maps and it does
not bulk-download from the public OpenStreetMap tile servers.

## GPX behaviour

- Imports GPX 1.1 tracks, routes, and waypoints through the system picker.
- Preserves disconnected segments, elevation, timestamps, and waypoint detail.
- Stores a versioned parsed route in application support storage.
- Accepts UTF-8 files up to 10 MB and 200,000 points.
- Rejects invalid coordinates, document type declarations, and empty geometry.
- Includes a Peak District demo route for simulator testing.

## MapLibre provider configuration

Development-alpha builds default to OpenFreeMap's public Liberty style for an
online, no-key basemap. Its public service has no availability guarantee, so it
is an alpha convenience rather than the production dependency. Persistent
offline caching stays disabled. Override the provider for production or a
self-hosted deployment with the settings below.

Supply an HTTPS MapLibre style whose tile, sprite, and glyph licences permit
mobile display and, if enabled, offline downloads:

```text
--dart-define=RIDE_RELAY_MAP_STYLE_URL=https://relay.example.com/maps/styles/ride-relay.json
--dart-define=RIDE_RELAY_TILE_ATTRIBUTION=© OpenStreetMap contributors
--dart-define=RIDE_RELAY_TILE_MAX_ZOOM=18
```

Offline download additionally requires explicit approval and a versioned cache
namespace:

```text
--dart-define=RIDE_RELAY_TILE_CACHE_ALLOWED=true
--dart-define=RIDE_RELAY_TILE_CACHE_NAMESPACE=open-map-style-v1
```

The app uses MapLibre's native offline-region database. It calculates a padded
route bounding box, downloads zoom levels 10–15, caps a request at 2,500 tiles,
shows progress, supports cancellation, and deletes only regions belonging to
the configured namespace. Long or antimeridian-crossing routes must be split.
The HTTPS style is validated, its relative resources are normalized, and an
approved copy is cached for 24 hours. If no valid style is reachable or cached,
the app falls back to a bundled blank style so the local route and overlays
remain visible instead of failing the whole map.

The older HTTPS raster XYZ configuration remains as a development fallback:

```text
--dart-define=RIDE_RELAY_TILE_URL=https://licensed.example/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
```

It is not the recommended production path.

## Self-hosted maps

The optional `maps` deployment profile runs the official MapLibre Martin tile
server and accepts operator-supplied MBTiles or PMTiles archives. Large datasets
and provider styles are deliberately excluded from Git. Put a schema-matched
archive in `deploy/maps/data`, its style/sprites/glyphs in
`deploy/maps/styles`, and start:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/compose.yaml \
  --profile maps up -d --build
```

OS Open Zoomstack is a viable free Great Britain dataset if its supplied style
and attribution are adapted together. OpenStreetMap-derived OpenMapTiles or
Protomaps data are other open choices, but their attribution and data/style
licences still apply. The public `tile.openstreetmap.org` service forbids bulk
offline downloading and is never a default.

## Offline states

| State | Route | Basemap |
|---|---|---|
| No provider | Fully local | Explicit route-only canvas |
| Style, offline not approved | Fully local | Online only |
| Style, offline approved and downloaded | Fully local | Native offline region |

Riders should open the prepared route in flight mode before departure. A
successful download is not a safety guarantee; real-device storage, provider,
and coverage edges remain part of the field-test matrix.
